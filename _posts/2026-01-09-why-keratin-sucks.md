        <p>If I see one more skin protein in a liver sample, I am going to scream.</p>
        
        <p>Here is the thing about proteomics: it is incredibly sensitive. If you look at your sample without gloves, we will sequence your thumb. If you sneeze near the bench, we will sequence your lunch.</p>

        <h3>The Golden Rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wear gloves.</li>
            <li>Don't lean over the tubes.</li>
